Web Chatting Platform:

This is my first development of a project in F#. The purpose is the know more about the features that this beautiful language provides, such as asychronous calls, actor models, concurrency control, etc. 

I am building a simple chat server, which might later become a web app, desktop app or a mobile app. 

Requirements: 

	F# compiler installed (.Net Framework) 
	Mac OS: MonoDevelop 
	Windows: .Net Framework 

	IDE: 

	Mac OS: Xamarin Studio
	Windows: Visual Studio
