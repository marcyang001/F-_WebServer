//Developing an HTTP Server Agent 
// The F# library doesnt include any special support for using agents for creating web servers 

// the programing model based on agents fits this problem domain extremely well and it is possible to use rich .Net libraries to create an agent that behabes as an HTTP web server

//implementing the agent type 
// the aim of this section is to create an HttpAgent type that behaves almost like the usual 
//Agent<'T>. 
//HttpAgent do not send messages to the agent explicitly. Instead, it starts listening on a specified port. 
// When a client connects to the server, the agent will generate a new message carrying the information about the connection 
// the code that uses the HttpAgent can specify how to react to the message (usually by sending a web page back) 

// the method takes a function representing the body of the agent as an argument 
//The function is is created for the buffering of incoming HTTP requests:

#if INTERACTIVE
#load @"program2"
#endif
