//uses pattern natcgubg to handle the two possible message types... 

//When the agent receives SEndMessage, the funcction creates a new XElement, appends it to the front of the list, keeping all messages in the chat room, and then calls itself recursively using return! 
// the return! construct means that control is transferred to the called workflow, so the recursion doesnt keep any stack that would overflow after a number of iterations 

//when the agent receives the GetContent message, it gets the reply channel as an argumen. 
// to build a response string, it creates a new <ul> element containing all current messages, converts it to string and sends it to the caller using the Reply method. 

//Then, the function continues looping with the current list of messages 

//The snippet showed a simple but fully functional agent

// How to create a new AsyncReplyChannel<string>? The answer is that the channel shouldn't be explicitly created by the user. 
//# PostAndReply 
// when using the PostAndReply method, the agent creates the channel and adds it to the message before sending it to the agent
// the method then blocks until the message is processed (and the agent sends back the room contents as string). 
// for testing purposes, the snippet uses a blocking method.
